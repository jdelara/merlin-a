# Merlin-A: a workbench to build adaptive modelling languages

Modelling languages are pervasive in software engineering to describe systems and processes. They are pivotal in model-driven engineering and low-code development, where automation solutions based on domain-specific languages (DSLs) need to be built
for particular domains. However, today's DSLs are rigid, since a single language needs to accommodate a wide variety of users with diverse backgrounds, modelling purposes, and usage scenarios. The new notion of adaptive modelling language attacks this limitation
by enabling the adaptation of a language to cater for the user expertise and purpose of use. 

Merlin-a is a workbench for adaptive languages, built as an Eclipse plugin. It relies on EMF, FeatureIDE and Henshin. It supports the creation of families of modelling language variants, migration transformations between the variants, language adaptation
triggers, and recommenders of language variants.

The tool website is at: https://miso.es/tools/merlin-adaptive/, and that website includes an update site, installation instructions and examples.
